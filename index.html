        <p class="lead">Welcome to my Home page. I am a full-time student at CSULB. I am currently in the engineering department and I am majoring in computer science. I graduated from Marina High School in 2020 and I have been attending CSULB for almost a year now. I started going to CSULB in Fall 2020 as a pre-computer science major. I plan on graduating by fall 2024. I spend my free time playing video games with friends and going out to hang with them. Although recently, I've only been able to do the former. My family consists of my mom, my dad, and little brother, and me. I hope to become a software engineer or work at one of my favorite video game companies. 

I also enjoy being active and exercising and although I've stopped now, I used to be a varsity athlete on my high school track team. I am excited for summer because I'll be able to finally spend a lot more time with my friends online and in person. (Once we're all fully vaccinated)</p>
